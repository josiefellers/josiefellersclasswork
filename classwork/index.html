<p> One of the city's most iconic sports figures will soon be immortalized
with a park and a statue on the University of Memphis campus.</p>
<p>University of Memphis President M. David Rudd announced Wednesday that the
school has formed a committee to create Larry Finch Memorial Park," which
will feature a statue of the former Tigers' basketball player and coach. </p>

<p>“The values Larry Finch lived were a model for us all, embracing the
strength of diversity, the importance of unity in the face of adversity
and the singular power of hope,” Rudd said in a statement on Thursday. </p>
<p>The location of the park on campus is still undetermined, although Rudd
hinted it will likely be on the school's Park Avenue campus near the
Laurie-Walton Family Basketball Center. He estimated the cost of the
project would be between $250,000 and $500,000. </p>
<p>“Coach Finch was more than a coach,” Penny Hardaway said in a statement.
“He was also a father figure. He helped me grow as a person and a
basketball player.” </p>
<p> As a player, Finch led Memphis State to the 1973 Final Four and the
Melrose High product later had his number retired by the university.</p>
<p> That team's success, and Finch's decision to stay home for college, is
credited with helping to heal some of the city's racial wounds in the
aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in 1968.</p>
<p> Finch later became the head coach at Memphis and took the Tigers to six
NCAA Tournament appearances, including a run to the Elite Eight in 1992
with Penny Hardaway. Finch remains the school's all-time winningest
basketball coach.</p>
<p> Finch died in 2011 at age 60.</p>
