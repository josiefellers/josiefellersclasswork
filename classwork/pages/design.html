				<h2> <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/10-principles-of-effective-web-
design/" target="_blank"> Principles Of Good Website Design And Effective Web Design Guidelines</a> </h2>

				<h3> By <a href="mailto:jinyang@memphis.edu"> Vitaly Friedman </a> </h3>
				<p> In order to use the principles properly we first need to understand how
users interact with websites, how they think and what are the basic
patterns of users' behavior.</p>
					<h4>How Do Users Think? </h4>
				<p>Basically, users’ habits on the Web aren’t that different from customers’
habits in a store. Visitors glance at each new page, scan some of the
text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely
resembles the thing they’re looking for. In fact, there are large parts of
the page they don’t even look at. </p>
				<p> Most users search for something interesting (or useful) and clickable; as
soon as some promising candidates are found, users click. If the new page
doesn’t meet users’ expectations, the Back button is clicked and the
search process is continued.</p>

				<ul> 
					<li>Users appreciate quality and credibility. If a page provides users with
high-quality content, they are willing to compromise the content with
advertisements and the design of the site. This is the reason why not-
that-well-designed websites with high-quality content gain a lot of
traffic over years. Content is more important than the design which
supports it. </li>
					<li> Users don’t read, they scan. Analyzing a web-page, users search for
some fixed points or anchors which would guide them through the content
of the page.</li>
					<li> Web users are impatient and insist on instant gratification. Very
simple principle: If a web-site isn’t able to meet users’ expectations,
then designer failed to get his job done properly and the company loses
money. The higher is the cognitive load and the less intuitive is the
navigation, the more willing are users to leave the web-site and search
for alternatives. [JN / DWU]</li>
					<li> Users don’t make optimal choices. Users don’t search for the quickest
way to find the information they’re looking for. Neither do they scan
webpage in a linear fashion, going sequentially from one site section
to another one. Instead users satisfice; they choose the first
reasonable option. As soon as they find a link that seems like it might
lead to the goal, there is a very good chance that it will be
immediately clicked. Optimizing is hard, and it takes a long time.
Satisficing is more efficient.</li>
					<li> Users follow their intuition. In most cases users muddle through
instead of reading the information a designer has provided. According
to Steve Krug, the basic reason for that is that users don’t care. “If
we find something that works, we stick to it. It doesn’t matter to us
if we understand how things work, as long as we can use them. If your
audience is going to act like you’re designing billboard, then design
great billboards.”</li>
					<li>Users want to have control. Users want to be able to control their
browser and rely on the consistent data presentation throughout the
site. E.g. they don’t want new windows popping up unexpectedly and they
want to be able to get back with a “Back”-button to the site they’ve
been before: therefore it’s a good practice to never open links in new
browser windows. </li>
